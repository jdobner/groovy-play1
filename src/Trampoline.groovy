/**
 * Recursive algorithms are often restricted by a physical limit: the maximum stack height. For example, if you call a method
 * that recursively calls itself too deep, you will eventually receive a StackOverflowException.
 *
 * An approach that helps in those situations is by using Closure and its trampoline capability.
 *
 * Closures are wrapped in a TrampolineClosure. Upon calling, a trampolined Closure will call the original Closure waiting for its result.
 * If the outcome of the call is another instance of a TrampolineClosure, created perhaps as a result to a call to the trampoline() method,
 * the Closure will again be invoked. This repetitive invocation of returned trampolined Closures instances will continue until a value other t
 * han a trampolined Closure is returned. That value will become the final result of the trampoline. That way, calls are made serially,
 * rather than filling the stack.
 *
 * Hereâ€™s an example of the use of trampoline() to implement the factorial function:
 **/

def factorial
factorial = { int n, def accu = 1G ->
    if (n < 2) return accu
    factorial.trampoline(n - 1, n * accu)
}
factorial = factorial.trampoline()

assert factorial(1)    == 1
assert factorial(3)    == 1 * 2 * 3
assert factorial(1000) // == 402387260.. plus another 2560 digits
